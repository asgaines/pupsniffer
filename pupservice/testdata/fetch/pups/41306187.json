Tasty treats and an upbeat attitude will go a long way to help him feel his best.  Blue will only be rehomed to a family with children aged 10 or older due to his tender personality.  While he casually interacts appropriately with most dogs, he was reported to guard his valued resources so is recommended as the only dog in his next home.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/66435f6d-6ac3-4352-96ea-77478eb7c487.jpg","Photo2":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/10506b29-cb57-4516-b3ee-174429f1954d.jpg","Photo3":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/20810a7a-62be-4254-ae82-221bfb8fc6b8.jpg","OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","DateOfSurrender":"2019-07-02 17:14:42","TimeInFormerHome":"2 Months","ReasonForSurrender":"Behavioral","PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"60 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2016-04-18","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"1","AgeGroup":"Adult","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"08","ChipNumber":"985113000695377","ColorPattern":{"0":"\n  "},"AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
