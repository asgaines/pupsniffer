This girl hopes to find a family that strikes the perfect balance of activity and lounge time.  Taffy can be stressed during her family&#39;s absence, so she will appreciate a family that is home often.  Taffy is recommended as the only dog in her next home, and she will only be re-homed to a family with children 10 years of age or older.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/dd263495-8c68-4547-b141-e2002b8ff895.jpg","Photo2":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/5b1c9b1e-e73c-4fb2-b15b-724525c49fa7.jpg","Photo3":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/dc38b0a3-b8ca-4980-af08-9757dcf7943e.jpg","OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","DateOfSurrender":"2019-08-11 15:53:56","TimeInFormerHome":"7 Weeks","ReasonForSurrender":"Behavioral","PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"64 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2015-05-17","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"1","AgeGroup":"Adult","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"12","ChipNumber":"982126054643966","ColorPattern":"Brindle","AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
