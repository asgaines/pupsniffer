This sensitive boy is eager to explore the wilds of Colorado!  Snoop appears to be inexperienced and a bit insecure around other dogs so is learning to feel relaxed and playful with the help of our Training and Behavior team.  This handsome fellow will enjoy lots of playtime and exercise, and with careful planning, may learn to love living with another dog!  Because of his tender personality, Snoop is recommended for a family with older or no children at this time.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/6a7279df-2c11-4a47-8ec2-80dfdc384158.jpg","Photo2":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/21be97cc-8224-496c-9e1c-99e3727a997b.jpg","Photo3":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/156811c6-9f44-43da-afbf-b7397adfbb90.jpg","OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","TimeInFormerHome":{"0":"\n  "},"ReasonForSurrender":{"0":"\n  "},"PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"62 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2018-05-11","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"1","AgeGroup":"Young","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"21","ChipNumber":"982126054865846","ColorPattern":{"0":"\n  "},"AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
