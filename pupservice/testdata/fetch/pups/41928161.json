This easy-going dog is eager to get out of the shelter to be spoiled by his family.  Bruno may enjoy living with a like-sized dog, but he will only be re-homed to a family without cats or other small animals.  He is recommended for a home without young children at this time.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/c395c8d5-cb94-49f6-ab77-99cf27911bc6.jpg","Photo2":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/4645793d-a190-42fc-b453-40fd91ce1e93.jpg","Photo3":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/153471e8-f063-47d0-8474-4b6dca6d9bc8.jpg","OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","DateOfSurrender":"2019-06-12 12:27:19","TimeInFormerHome":"6 Months","ReasonForSurrender":"Reasons unrelated to animal","PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"49 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2012-06-13","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"Dog","AgeGroup":"Adult","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"01","ChipNumber":"981020017245281","ColorPattern":{"0":"\n  "},"AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
