She&#39;s a little shy at first but warms up beautifully. She enjoys being held lovingly, starring into your eyes, falling asleep in your lap, play time with humans, puppies and kitties, rolling around in grass and walks in the park. She was born a master walker. She&#39;s adorably loyal and loves to follow you outside. Not only does Starshine love receiving kisses, she also loves giving kisses.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/94f6c805-9726-4607-a349-381e4f9c7d13.jpg","Photo2":{"0":"\n  "},"Photo3":{"0":"\n  "},"OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","TimeInFormerHome":{"0":"\n  "},"ReasonForSurrender":{"0":"\n  "},"PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"6 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2019-06-14","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"Dog","AgeGroup":"Baby","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"50","ChipNumber":"982126055844434","ColorPattern":"Tricolor","AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
