She&#39;s had several transitions recently and is ready to settle into a loving home.  Matilda will likely enjoy long walks and lounging in a sunny spot in the yard.  Easygoing girl!  Matilda can be possessive of her food, so she is recommended to live in a home without other dogs.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/1db493c5-4f0e-4e2f-be10-bbc613fd119f.jpg","Photo2":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/bbe957a7-a26b-4a23-b973-7113678371cf.jpg","Photo3":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/2544b0b4-d893-416c-a3e0-d38f9394da0d.jpg","OnHold":"No","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","DateOfSurrender":"2019-08-08 13:29:50","TimeInFormerHome":"2 Weeks","ReasonForSurrender":"Behavioral","PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"63 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2011-08-08","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"Dog","AgeGroup":"Adult","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"16","ChipNumber":"981020011281300","ColorPattern":{"0":"\n  "},"AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
