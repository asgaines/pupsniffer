She will appreciate a patient guardian who will understand her need to sometimes take things slow.  Tasty treats and a gentle approach will help Dolphin feel her best.  She may enjoy living with a like-sized dog, and HSBV will only re-home Dolphin to a family with children 10 years of age or older.","Photo1":"http:\/\/g.petango.com\/photos\/993\/468894ba-12b3-4eae-a833-49cd25db21cb.jpg","Photo2":{"0":"\n  "},"Photo3":{"0":"\n  "},"OnHold":"Yes","SpecialNeeds":{"0":"\n  "},"NoDogs":{"0":"\n  "},"NoCats":{"0":"\n  "},"NoKids":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorResult":{"0":"\n  "},"MemoList":{},"Site":"Humane Society of Boulder Valley","TimeInFormerHome":{"0":"\n  "},"ReasonForSurrender":{"0":"\n  "},"PrevEnvironment":"Unknown                       ","LivedWithChildren":"No","LivedWithAnimals":"No","LivedWithAnimalTypes":{"0":"\n  "},"BodyWeight":"8 pounds","DateOfBirth":"2014-08-08","ARN":{"0":"\n  "},"VideoID":{"0":"\n  "},"BehaviorTestList":{},"Stage":"Available","AnimalType":"1","AgeGroup":"Adult","WildlifeIntakeInjury":{"0":"\n  "},"WildlifeIntakeCause":{"0":"\n  "},"BuddyID":"0","Featured":"No","Sublocation":"11-B","ChipNumber":"985141001614149","ColorPattern":{"0":"\n  "},"AdoptionApplicationUrl":{"0":"\n  "},"BannerURL":"https:\/\/ws.petango.com\/webservices\/adoptablesearch\/images\/24PW-Web-Services-Graphic-Trial.png"}
